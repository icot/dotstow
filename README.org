* dotstow

** Description

This little tool is a GNU Guile implementation of part of the functionality of
the GNU Stow utility, dependint strongly on certain assumptions (see list),
while fixing stow issues with "dot-" syntax for folders, and adding support
for basic templating to address some limitations I found when deploying
certain of my dot files on different systems with different usernames, etc.
 
** Assumptions

- FOLDER is located in ${HOME}/<whatever-name-you-use>/FOLDER
- files to be ignored are suffixed with '-nostow' or '-NOSTOW'
- dot files or folder names are preffixed by 'dot-'
- template file names are preffixed by 'template-'
    - templates are evaluable Guile scripts returning the contents to be
    written to the intended file (OBVIOUSLY UNSAFE)

** Usage, examples

Usage: ~dostow FOLDER~
